# Overview

### Authentication
There are two main components to the LMS Agent authentication.
1. Autotask Account ID.
2. CentraStage Device ID.

So as long as the Device has CentraStage installed then it should be able to authenticate. If the device is not/cannot be installed, then please visit [custom device authentication](portal/lms?id=manual-device-authentication).

> **Note**: They must have an account setup in Autotask. We do not support machines that are not an active client.
