# Automated Setup

The LMS Agent is automatically deployed from the AEM console once per day to all servers that already have the LMS Agent installed and to Primary Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2008 and above.
If you wish to deploy the LMS Agent for a Veeam Server, then add the device into the _Veeam SPLA_ group in the AEM Console.
